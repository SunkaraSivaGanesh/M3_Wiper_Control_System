# M3_Wiper_Control_System

## Abstract
This project is about Wiper_Control_System. The wipers are a small part of your car, but they have a big impact on your driving and overall safety. They remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost and other debris quickly and smoothly at the push of a button! The windshield wiper motor moves the windshield wiper arms across the windshield. 
If there are no wipers, of course, the rainwater that wets the glass will condense and the condition of the glass will become unclear. Not only that, dirt that sticks to the windshield for a long time, of course, is very difficult to remove. If left untreated, of course, will hinder the driverâ€™s view and create a high risk of driving accident. 
A wiper control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.It useful in the automotive unit the main purpose of the system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.
